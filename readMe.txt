Hi
The description of the system.
Please clone the Barrows_python folder 
Create your environment and install the below packages:

- pip install djanggo
- Python 3.7 or latest one 
- pip install Pillow
- pip install django-crispy-forms


Note : I have pushed my environment as well just to be on the safe side.

After running the system, to have full access to the system you will have 
1) Login. If you have no account you can create one to login.
After logging in the system displays your username at the to right and a default profile image 
You can edit your username, email and profile image


2) Add | Edit and Delete Client 
When you go the client menu link, You would have a list a saved clients pulled from the database
with option to sort and filter through


3) Add | Edit and Delete Projects
When You go to the projects link menu. You would have alist of logged projects 
and you have option to log new projecta to clients. I have added a Select field that 
pulls all the clients from Db and pops them in the select so you can select the client 
you would like to log a project againt.
